# TopCV

## Overview

The client-side application is built using `JavaScript/React/Vite`, and it handles:

```text
- CV creation
- AI-powered CV assessment
- Spell-checker for all input texts
- Exporting into PDF and public link
```

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
